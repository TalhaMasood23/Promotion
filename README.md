## Description
The **Promotion** project is designed to demonstrate basic web development skills using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This project simulates a sarcastic promotional interaction. It presents users with a question asking, "Do you want a promotion?" The "Yes" option is selectable, while the "No" option is visible but cannot be selected or interacted with. This creates a playful and ironic experience, emphasizing the inevitability of selecting "Yes."
